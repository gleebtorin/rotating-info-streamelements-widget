A rotating info widget for Stream Elements.

1. Open or create a new overlay.
2. Add a Custom Widget by clicking the + icon at the bottom left of the overlay display, selecting 'Static/Custom', and then 'Custom widget'.
3. The editor will display the settings on the Left Panel. Select 'Open Editor' at the top.
4. Paste the contents of the appropriate files into the approiate tabs.

| Tab | File |
| - | - |
| HTML | widget.html |
| CSS | widget.css |
| JS | widget.js |
| FIELDS | fields.json |
| DATA | data.json |

5. Click Done

Once this is complete, you'll be able to change the settings for the widget in the settings tab.
